        "- SVD decomposition will give you the basis vectors.\n",
        "- SVD will also tell you which of the vectors are important.\n",
        "- You **must** do it using SVD (**use only np.linalg.svd**). There are other ways of doing this, but this is meant to show you something very specific about basis vectors. It may be hard but should be enlightening.\n",
        "- In particular don't use existing libraries from the dimensionality reduction part -- they may be convenient but they will hide important details you should understand.\n",
        "- The basis you create on the train data **must** be also used for the test data. (It's not okay to compute another basis based on the test data.)\n",
        "- You **MUST** use the two important functions we developed in class for change of basis (they're in the notebook)!\n",
        "- You **MUST NOT import any other libraries** (beyond what I included for you below)!\n",
        "- Performing a reliable data analysis is the main goal here -- doing it only halfways or not making an effort to understand any intermediate step **will severely reduce your score**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tips:\n",
        "- It's **not** about random projections (although some parts are similar so going back to that may be useful).\n",
        "- During class we did rank-k approximation using SVD on a **single image** -- this is similar, but we now work with a collection of images. So the idea of using only a subset of basis vectors applies -- but it's definitely not going to be the same.\n",
        "- Also the class we did on change of basis will be super useful. I'd have another look at it.\n",
        "- To some extent the class/colab about k-means may be useful. Again, it's not going to be exactly the same.\n",
        "- **Do read through the whole thing first**, and try make sure you understand the overall goal.\n",
        "- It's one single continuous analysis. I just broke it down into managable steps for you.\n",
